## Deliverable 1 - Making Sense of the Data

Comment on how each of the data could inform on which activity is happening. Use your plots as a reference. [15 points]

Your task will be to compute mean and variance of acceleration for each segment. [14 points]

- Please find the implementation in the uploaded code.

Comment on how each of the features could inform on which activity is happening. Use your plots as a reference. [15 points]

## Deliverable 2 - Personal-dependent Model

Using the values in the confusion matrix to compute the precision, recall, and accuracy scores for each of the activities. [9 points]

Calculate the precision, recall and accuracy scores for all activities. Compare this with the results from Deliverable 2, comment on the differences. [12 points]

What are the top features? [10 points]

Think about whether these features make sense or not. [10 points] 

Discuss which other sensors and features help classifying these activities more accurately. [15 points]
